        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bibimbap – Trust the Koreans to transform the humble rice bowl into a recipe that’s revered all around the world! With a kaleidoscope of seasoned sautéed vegetables, Korean marinated beef, and the signature fried egg, the thing that really seals the deal is the bright red, spicy Bibimbap Sauce that I can’t get enough of.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h3>Meat and Meat Sauce</h3>

                <li>120g (4.2 ounces) carrots (1 small)</li>
